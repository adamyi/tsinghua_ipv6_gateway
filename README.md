My script on network gateway server to connect to VPN of Tsinghua University to provide IPv6 support to my home network.

IPv6 is available almost only to educational network in China, and GFW does not support IPv6 yet.

I use 115:2000::/32 for my private network with NAT6. Be advised that using NAT in IPv6 is against the intentions of IPv6.
